# How to install multiple apps in Real Devices on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=appium-java-testNG-multipleApps) using Appium in the Java TestNG Framework

While performing app automation testing with appium on LambdaTest Grid, you might face a scenario where the APP1 that you are testing needs to interact with a few other applications APP2, APP3. In this scenario, LambdaTest offers an easy way out where you can just [upload your apps](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/appium-java/#upload-your-application) & add them to the multiple apps array.
It becomes extremely convenient now where you can just add those URLs & run your tests with ease. 

# Steps:

You can add the app URLs fetched by [uploading your apps](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/appium-java/#upload-your-application) in the ```otherApps``` capability.

You can make this change in the ```AndroidApp.java``` and ```iOSApp.java```:

Below is the ```AndroidApp.java``` example shown:

```java
public class AndroidApp {
    String userName = System.getenv("LT_USERNAME") == null ?
            "username" : System.getenv("LT_USERNAME"); //Add username here
    String accessKey = System.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY") == null ?
            "accessKey" : System.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY"); //Add accessKey here
    public String gridURL = "@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub";
    AppiumDriver driver;
    @Test
    @org.testng.annotations.Parameters(value = {"device", "version", "platform"})
    public void AndroidApp1(String device, String version, String platform) {
        try {
            DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
            capabilities.setCapability("build","Java TestNG Android");
            capabilities.setCapability("name",platform+" "+device+" "+version);
            capabilities.setCapability("deviceName", device);
            capabilities.setCapability("platformVersion",version);
            capabilities.setCapability("platformName", platform);
            capabilities.setCapability("isRealMobile", true);
            capabilities.setCapability("app", "lt://"); //Enter your app url
            capabilities.setCapability("deviceOrientation", "PORTRAIT");
            capabilities.setCapability("console", true);
            capabilities.setCapability("network", false);
            capabilities.setCapability("visual", true);
            capabilities.setCapability("devicelog", true);

            // ADD THE APP URL OF OTHER APPS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO INSTALL ON THE SAME DEVICE
            capabilities.setCapability("otherApps", "[\"APP_ID\", \"APP_ID\"]");   // ENTER THE OTHER APP URLs HERE IN AN ARRAY FORMAT

            String hub = "https://" + userName + ":" + accessKey + gridURL;
            driver = new AppiumDriver(new URL(hub), capabilities);
            MobileElement color = (MobileElement) driver.findElementById("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/color");
            //Changes color to pink
            color.click();
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            MobileElement text = (MobileElement) driver.findElementById("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/Text");
            //Changes the text to "Proverbial"
            text.click();
            //toast will be visible
            MobileElement toast = (MobileElement) driver.findElementById("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/toast");
            toast.click();
            //notification will be visible
            MobileElement notification = (MobileElement) driver.findElementById("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/notification");
            notification.click();
            Thread.sleep(2000);
            //Opens the geolocation page
            MobileElement geo = (MobileElement) driver.findElementById("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/geoLocation");
            geo.click();
            Thread.sleep(5000);
            //takes back to home page
            MobileElement home = (MobileElement) driver.findElementByAccessibilityId("Home");
            home.click();
            driver.quit();
            
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            try{
                driver.quit();
            }catch(Exception e1){
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### **Step 3: Execute Your Test Case**
Debug and run your code. Run iOSApp.java or AndroidApp.java in your editor.
```
mvn clean install -DsuiteXmlFile=src/test/java/Android.xml
```
```
mvn clean install -DsuiteXmlFile=src/test/java/IOS.xml
```

Info: Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the üîó LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard.
